// You shouldn't need anything more than booleans, arrays, and operators to accomplish this

// #1
// update your list of colors to be sorted in alphabetical order

// #2
// print out the 3rd element in the $colors array, after you sorted it

// #3
// create another array of colors that are available as M&Ms
// create a new array that contains only the items from $colors that 
// are available as M&M's

// #4
// calculate the sum of all the numbers contained in $numbers and print it out

// #5
// print out the total number of array elements in $colors and $numbers. Then print if that total number is less than 10.
